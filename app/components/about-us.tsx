            and his team, Melin, Lita, Delphy, and Artha.

            Astrophile is a brand-new club formed in 2024. The name
            &apos;Astrophile&apos; means someone who loves everything about the
            sky. Because even above the sky, there&apos;s still Astrophile! The
            founders and staff of Astrophile have a dream of creating a small
            family within the Ayodance community. We want to be friends not just
            in the game, but also in real life. That&apos;s why Astrophile was
            created. We hope this club can be a solid, close-knit group where we
            can leave the drama behind. After all, the goal of Astrophile is to
            make new friends, not enemies.
